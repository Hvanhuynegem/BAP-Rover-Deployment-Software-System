\chapter{Introduction}


Serial is a library that facilities easy-to-use access to the serial bus on a Linux machine.
It does support both UART and RS-485 communication protocols.
Serial is also supposed to work on multiple Linux platform. Currently the Raspberry Pi is the supported platform, but support for the BeagleBone Black and the OBC will be added in the near future.
